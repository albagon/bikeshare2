# Bikeshare

Hi! This is my final project repo for Introduction to Version Control. This script explores data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States and gives interesting statistics according to the user's input.

### Running the script

In order to run and modify this script you will need Python 3, NumPy and pandas installed on your computer. As mentioned on the [pandas 0.24.2 documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html):

> The simplest way to install not only pandas, but Python
> and the most popular packages that make up the SciPy stack
> (IPython, NumPy, Matplotlib, â€¦) is with Anaconda,
> a cross-platform (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows) Python distribution
> for data analytics and scientific computing.

Instructions for installing Anaconda can be found [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

You also need to make a copy of this repo on your computer using your terminal.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/albagon/pdsnd_github.git
```

And finally, run the script.

```sh
$ python bikeshare_2.py
```
